Monitoring Environmental Waste Utilization Scores

A central objective of waste management is to reduce impacts associated with waste generation and treatment to protect human health and the environment. Environmental Waste Utilization quantifies the share of the environmental value of disposed materials which is utilized through waste management. As part of the Environmental Waste Utilization Dashboard (EWU Dashboard) Environmental Waste Utilization scores are calculated to assess the capability of waste management systems to reduce the adverse impacts of waste generation and waste management. The EWU Dashboard enables to explore Environmental Waste Utilization scores for various waste management systems under changing boundary conditions and increases the transparency of indicator calculations. The EWU Dashboard, in form of the “EWU_Dashboard.xlsx”-file, can be shared easily and is accessible also for practitioners or policymakers without profound knowledge of LCA or access to LCA software or databases.
The MoEWe Notebook (MoEWe.ipynb) provides guidance for generating standardized EWU Dashboards based on a spreadsheet template (EWU_InputTemplate.xlsx). MoEWe extensively uses the packages Brightway2 (https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2) and “XlsxWriter” (https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter) in combination with the ecoinvent database (https://ecoinvent.org/). To observe the effects related to anticipated changes of material and energy systems based on integrated assessment models, MoEWe provides the integration of prospective databases created with the Python package “premise” (https://github.com/polca/premise). The proposed workflow for generating EWU Dashboards is documented below.
